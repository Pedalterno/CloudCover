In the configuration file

tr: Treshold. Red/Blue threshold used to classify the image pixels. Given
an image pixel p, if RBRatio(p) < tr then p is classified as "Sky pixel"
else is classified as "Cloud pixel". Default = 0.95.

ns: Neighborhood side size. Odd positive number whose value is the side
neighborhood size used in convolution. The neighborhood around a given
central pixel is ns pixels by side. Default = 5.

vc: Value to change the pixel classification. Given a pixel p previously
classified as "sky" or "cloud", if its neighborhood have, at least, vc
pixels in the another class, then the pixel is changed to such class.
Default = 12.

mskfile: Fully qualified name for the mask file. The mask file is a PNG
file, four channels (RGB + Transp) with a pure opaque white circle in the
region in which the image is, and pure transparent black pixels around
elsewhere. Default = /Images/msk-sqr-png-transp.png

geolocationfile: Fully qualified name for the geographic location file.
Example: Thahuizcalpan.xml

azimuth: camera orientation clockwise angle, respect to the north.

## croppeddir: directory where the cropped original images will be stored, if
## requested.

## segmenteddir: directory where the segmented images will be stored, if
## requested.
