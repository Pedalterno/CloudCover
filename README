Introduction

This program is intended to calculate, based on full-sky photographs,
the Cloud Cover Index (CCI). It is part of theAtmosferic Exploration
and Record Project of the School of Sciences of the Universidad
Nacional Autónoma de México.

The program receives as input:
A picture of the sky in JPEG format with EXIF data (used by most
digital cameras).
An XML file with some configuration parameters.
An XML file with the camera's accurate geographic location.

As output, the program provides:
The CCI calculation based on the classification of image pixels.
The segmented image with pixels classified as sky in black, and white those classified as cloud.

The segmentation algorithm classifies the pixels according to its
ratio R/B (where R and B are the the red and blue component of pixel
color, respectively), as described in the paper:

Roy, G., S. Hayman y W. Julian, "Sky analysis from CCD images: cloud
cover", Lighting Research Technology, Vol. 33, No. 4, pp. 211-222,
2001.

The input pictures are 4368 pixels width and 2912 pixels height. Since
the camera uses a special lens, the sky is completely contained in a
central circle with a radius of 1324 pixels. These images are JPEG
RGB, 8 bits depth in each component.

The program has been writen in C and uses the following libraries:

libjpeg version 8c (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.8.0.2)
libpng version 1.2.46 (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libpng12.so)
libexif version 12.3.2 (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libexif.so.12.3.2)
libexpat version 1.5.2 (/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libexpatw.so.1.5.2)

The date and time calculations are based in the ANSI C code of the
SOFA library, provided by the International Astronomical Union
(http://www.iausofa.org/current_C.html).
